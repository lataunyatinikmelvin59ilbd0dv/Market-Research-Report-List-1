<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tire Pressure Monitor Control Modules Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wheel-Speed Based(Indirect TPMS)</li><li>Pressure-Sensor Based(Direct TPMS)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Tire Pressure Monitor Control Modules market types include wheel-speed based (indirect TPMS) and pressure-sensor based (direct TPMS) systems. Indirect TPMS uses wheel speed sensors to monitor tire pressure, alerting drivers to potential issues. Direct TPMS uses individual sensors in each tire to provide real-time pressure readings. Indirect TPMS is generally less expensive but may not be as accurate as direct TPMS, which provides more precise data for drivers to monitor their tire pressure effectively.</p></p>
