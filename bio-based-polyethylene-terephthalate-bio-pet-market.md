<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio Based Polyethylene Terephthalate (Bio PET) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dimethyl terephthalate process</li><li>Terephthalic acid process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bio-based Polyethylene Terephthalate (BioPET) is produced through two main processes - Dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) process and Terephthalic acid (PTA) process. In the DMT process, dimethyl terephthalate is produced from terephthalic acid and methanol, which is then polymerized to form BioPET. On the other hand, the PTA process involves the direct esterification of terephthalic acid with ethylene glycol to produce BioPET. Both processes have their own market types and applications in the production of sustainable and eco-friendly plastics.</p></p>
