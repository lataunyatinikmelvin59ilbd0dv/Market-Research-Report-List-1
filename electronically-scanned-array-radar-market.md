<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronically Scanned Array Radar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Phased Array</li><li>Active Phased Array</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electronically Scanned Array (ESA) Radar technology consists of two main market types: Passive Phased Array and Active Phased Array. Passive Phased Array radars rely on receiving signals from external sources, such as communication satellites, to detect and track targets. On the other hand, Active Phased Array radars transmit their own signals to detect and track targets. Both types offer advantages such as faster target acquisition and tracking, wider coverage, and reduced vulnerability to electronic countermeasures. The market for both Passive and Active Phased Array radars is expected to grow significantly in the coming years.</p></p>
