<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Endotracheal Tube Cuffs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Pressure-Low Volume Endotracheal Tube Cuffs</li><li>Low Pressure-High Volume Endotracheal Tube Cuffs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Endotracheal tube cuffs are available in two main types: high pressure-low volume cuffs and low pressure-high volume cuffs. High pressure-low volume cuffs are designed to provide a smaller surface area in contact with the tracheal wall, which helps reduce the risk of tracheal damage. On the other hand, low pressure-high volume cuffs are designed to distribute pressure more evenly along the tracheal wall, reducing the risk of pressure-related complications. Both types have their own benefits and are used based on individual patient needs.</p></p>
