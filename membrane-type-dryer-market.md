<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Membrane Type Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Porous</li><li>Non-Porous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Membrane Type Dryer market types include Porous and Non-Porous membranes. Porous membranes are made up of small pores that allow water vapor to pass through while blocking larger molecules, making them ideal for drying gases. Non-Porous membranes, on the other hand, do not have any pores and instead rely on a selective permeation process to separate water vapor from gas streams. Both types of membranes are used in industrial applications to remove moisture from gases for various processes.</p></p>
