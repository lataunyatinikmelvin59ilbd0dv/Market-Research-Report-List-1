<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disc Industrial Brakes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fixed Disc Type</li><li>Floating Plate</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Disc Industrial Brakes can be categorized into two main types: Fixed Disc Type and Floating Plate. Fixed Disc Type brakes have stationary discs that do not move, while the braking force is applied directly to the disc surface. Floating Plate brakes have a disc that is mounted on a floating plate, allowing for radial movement during braking. These types of brakes are commonly used in heavy-duty industrial applications where high braking torque and precision control are required.</p></p>
