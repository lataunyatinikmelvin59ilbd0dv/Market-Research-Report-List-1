<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Trauma Fixation Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internal Fixation Devices</li><li>External Fixation Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Trauma fixation devices are medical instruments used to stabilize fractures and facilitate the healing process. Internal fixation devices are implants that are surgically inserted into the body, such as plates, screws, and rods, to hold broken bones in place. These devices are usually left in the body permanently. On the other hand, external fixation devices are temporary devices attached to the outside of the body to stabilize fractures, typically using pins or wires. They are used when internal fixation is not possible or deemed inappropriate.</p></p>
