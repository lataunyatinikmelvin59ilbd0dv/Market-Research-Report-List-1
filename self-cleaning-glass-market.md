<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Cleaning Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic Coatings</li><li>Hydrophobic Coatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-cleaning glass refers to a type of glass that has a built-in cleaning mechanism, reducing the need for manual cleaning. It is available in two main types: hydrophilic coatings and hydrophobic coatings. Hydrophilic coatings enable the glass to attract and spread water evenly, creating a thin film that washes away dirt and grime when it rains. In contrast, hydrophobic coatings repel water, causing it to form droplets that roll off the glass, taking dirt particles with them. Both types provide efficient cleaning solutions, making the glass low-maintenance and enhancing clarity and aesthetics.</p></p>
