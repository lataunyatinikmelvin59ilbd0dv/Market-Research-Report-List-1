<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Bricks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unshaped (Monolithic Refractories)</li><li>Shaped</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire bricks are classified into two main market types: unshaped (monolithic refractories) and shaped. Unshaped fire bricks are in a powder form and are typically used for creating custom shapes on-site. In contrast, shaped fire bricks are pre-molded into specific shapes and sizes for easier installation. Both types of fire bricks are essential for lining high-temperature applications such as furnaces, kilns, and boilers, providing thermal insulation and resistance to extreme heat.</p></p>
