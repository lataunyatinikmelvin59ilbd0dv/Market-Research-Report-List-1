<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gravity Retaining Wall Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oblique</li><li>Pitching</li><li>Upright</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gravity retaining walls are used to provide stability and support to structures by utilizing the weight of the wall material itself to resist lateral pressure. There are three main types of gravity retaining walls: oblique, pitching, and upright. </p><p>Oblique walls are built at an angle to the horizontal plane, providing stability through the sloping of the wall face. Pitching walls have a stepped or terraced appearance, which helps to distribute pressure evenly across the wall. Upright walls are vertical with a uniform cross-section, offering a sleek and modern aesthetic.</p></p>
