<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Desiccants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Physical Absorption</li><li>Chemical Absorption</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Physical Absorption desiccants work by physically adsorbing water molecules onto their surface, such as silica gel or activated carbon. Chemical Absorption desiccants chemically bond with water molecules to remove moisture from the air, like calcium chloride or molecular sieves. Physical absorption desiccants are preferred for applications where the desiccant can be easily replaced or regenerated, while chemical absorption desiccants are more effective in high humidity environments or for long-term moisture control. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining product quality and prolonging shelf-life.</p></p>
