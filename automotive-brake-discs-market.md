<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Brake Discs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Type</li><li>Disc Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive brake discs market consists of two main types: drum type and disc type. Drum brakes are enclosed within a drum-shaped housing and operate by pressing brake shoes against the drum's interior surface to slow down the vehicle. Disc brakes, on the other hand, have a disc-shaped rotor that rotates with the wheel, and brake pads are pressed against the rotor to create friction and stop the vehicle. Both types have their advantages and are widely used in the automotive industry.</p></p>
