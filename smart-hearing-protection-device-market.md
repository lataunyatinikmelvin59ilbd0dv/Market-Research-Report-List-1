<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Hearing Protection Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Earplugs</li><li>Earmuffs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Smart Hearing Protection Device market includes two main types: Earplugs and Earmuffs. Earplugs are small, insertable devices that fit into the ear canal to block out noise. They are portable, discreet, and often reusable. Earmuffs, on the other hand, are large cups that cover the ears and provide a physical barrier against sound. They are typically adjustable and offer a higher level of protection than earplugs. Both types of hearing protection devices are designed to reduce the risk of hearing damage from loud environments.</p></p>
